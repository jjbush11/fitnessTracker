# Fitness Tracker Python Program

This project was completed in a team of two people. The program tracks macronutrient and calorie goals. It allows the user to enter the foods they've eaten and enter new types of food into the pool of data which it draws from. The user can check how many calories they've consumed, along with the amount of protein, carbohydrates, and fats.
